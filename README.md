# memz

A new version of [Leurak's MEMZ Trojan](https://github.com/Leurak/MEMZ), with cleaner code and cleaner structure.

If you #define \__HARMFUL\__, this program WILL damage your computer.

I am NOT responsible for any damage caused by this program.

Differences from the original:

* New code structure to make it easier to read
* Can be compiled and linked with MinGW or Clang
* There is no GUI sandbox option
* Simpler payload delay algorithm (affects acceleration of payload cicle)
* Assembly/Images/Song not included as resources (only as bytes already embedded in the code)
